        <p>I am a Chicago-based full-stack engineer with a background in education and software development.  After teaching high school history for five years, I wanted to approach education from a different angle and decided to pursue studying web development full-time.  Because of my experience in the classroom, I understand how valuable educational technology is in an increasingly digital world, and Iâ€™m ready to start working on a project that is going to transform the educational experience for students around the world.</p>
